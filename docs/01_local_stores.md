# Local Stores

## Auto detected

kview will look in the default Deno location for any datastores and will list
them under their globally unique ID. For example:

<img src="/images/local_stores.png" alt="screenshot of local stores" width="400" class="mx-auto" />

## Adding a local store

Stores can be added manually by selecting the _Add local store_ button and
providing the path to the local store file from the perspective of where the
kview server is hosted.

A user friendly name can be assigned to the store as well.

## Naming local stores

Local stores by default are labelled _[unnamed]_ but can be adjusted by clicking
the label which will change to edit mode on a list of local stores or selecting
the _Update local info_ button when navigating to a local store.
